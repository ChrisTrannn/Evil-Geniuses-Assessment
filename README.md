# Evil Geniuses Assessment

## Installation
To run the code, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the following dependencies:
* pandas: pip install pandas
* matplotlib: pip install matplotlib
Run the main.py file to start executing the script.

## Task A: Common Strategy
The code snippet checks if entering the light blue boundary is a common strategy used by Team2 on the T (terrorist) side. It determines the proportion of entries within the boundary and compares it to a threshold of 50%. The result is displayed in the console.

## Task B: Average Entry Time
The code calculates the average time it takes for Team2 on the T side to enter BombsiteB with at least 2 rifles or SMGs. The average time is displayed in the console.

## Task C: CT Side Analysis
For task C, additional implementation is required. This task involves examining the CT (counter-terrorist) side of Team2 inside BombsiteB. To provide insights to the coaching staff, you can extend the ProcessGameState class or create a separate method to analyze player positions, past behavior, or any relevant factors. The results should be printed or displayed in the desired format.

## Task No Code:
The solution I proposed is a web app that uses Flask as the backend
to handle incoming requests from the user data. See more details
in the results folder.

## Results
The results to the questions are provided in the results folder as a text file. Along with the answer to the (No Coding) question.
